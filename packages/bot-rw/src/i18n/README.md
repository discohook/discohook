# Contributing translations to Discohook

Hello. If you would like to help translate Discohook into non-English languages, please do so via the web interface at [translate.shay.cat](https://translate.shay.cat/engage/discohook/), and not by editing these files directly. If you link your GitHub account to your Weblate account, you will be credited in your commits.

If you have any questions, coordinate with us on the [Discord server](https://discohook.app/discord) - we have a channel for translators.
