If you created it manually, copy the Webhook URL and paste it in the \"input a webhook URL manually\" part of the Add Webhook menu, at the top of the Discohook editor.\n\nThe Discohook editor can be found at https://discohook.app."},"edit":{"title":"How do I edit messages?","description":"This process is easier with [our companion bot](https://discohook.app/bot), but it's not necessary.","fields":[{"name":"If you have the bot (Discohook Utils)","value":"1.
