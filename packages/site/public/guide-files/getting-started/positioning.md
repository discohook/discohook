# Component Positioning

Message components like buttons and select menus are contained in what are called action rows (or just "rows"). Each standard message can have up to 5 action rows, and components-based messages can have up to 40 total components, including the components inside each row. The maximum "width" of a row is 5 units:

- Button: 1 unit wide (5 per row)
- Select Menu: 5 units wide (1 per row)

To move a component within its row, just use the up and down arrows on the right side. If there is another row somewhere in the message with space for it, you can press the "Move" button to instantly shift the component to that row.

A row can be inserted at any point above or below another component in the message, as long as there is enough room for it. You can do this by clicking the "Add Row" separator.
