# Link Embeds

Discohook's Link Embeds editor can be used to create embeds that you can post in any server, so long as you have the "Embed Links" permission. Most servers have this enabled for everyone or locked behind a low-level rank, but some servers do have it disabled entirely. Don't post link embeds in servers where the moderators have made it apparent that they are not welcome.

## Create a Link Embed

Visit the [link embed editor](discohook://link) to get started. You will see an interface just like the main editor for webhook messages. You may notice some extra fields: redirect URL, embed provider, and embed video.

- Redirect URL: By default, when someone clicks on your link in Discord, they will just be shown the preview of the embed. If you set a redirect URL, they will be automatically taken to that link.
- Provider: This is an extra bit of text that can be shown above the author name. It can be hyperlinked just like the author name!
- Images: Up to four large images can be in a link embed, or one small thumbnail. The last 3 large images may not display on mobile devices.
- Video: You can embed a YouTube, Vimeo, or plain (e.g. mp4) video in your link embeds just by pasting the link. This cannot be used simultaneously with images.

## Post Your Link Embed

Enter a name for your embed at the top and press "Save". The "Copy Link" button will light up--press it to get a link that you can paste in Discord. If you have the right permissions, your embed should appear within a few seconds!

If you make any changes within about 30 minutes, you will need to copy the slightly modified link below the name box so that Discord knows it needs to refresh its data for that message. Old messages (that you haven't edited) will not refresh automatically.

Happy linking!
