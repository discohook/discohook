# Link Embeds

Discohook's Link Embeds editor can be used to create embeds that you can post in any server, so long as you have the "Embed Links" permission. Most servers have this enabled for everyone or locked behind a low-level rank, but some servers do have it disabled entirely. Don't post link embeds in servers where the moderators have made it apparent that they are not welcome.

## Embed Type

When creating a link embed, you can set the type to "Standard" or "Post". The standard type is how most link embeds appear on Discord, where all fields are optional and markdown is not accepted in the description. A post-type embed will be configured to look more like a blog post, tweet, or article.
