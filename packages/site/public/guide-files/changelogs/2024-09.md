## New
- Any autocomplete menu that allows you to select a webhook will now also show the channel that the webhook is in
- The **Webhook Info** message command now has buttons to use the webhook and get its URL, just like </webhook info:1>
- The </welcomer set:1> command is back, enabling you to create triggers for members joining & leaving using preset flows
  - **channel** and **webhook** - only one of these is required. This sets the destination for the message.
  - **share-link** - Use a share link generated in the **Share** menu on Discohook. (looks like `https://discohook.app/?share=...`)
  - **delete-after** - Optionally delete the message after up to a minute (use 0 to remove this)
  - </welcomer view:1> - Check on a welcomer configuration & edit the message on Discohook
  - </welcomer delete:1> - Delete a welcomer
- When selecting a webhook from your server, Discohook will now show you the channel that the webhook is in - especially useful if you have multiple similarly-named webhooks
- There is now a link to edit the backup selected in send message actions
- Added navigation buttons to the backups page and share links page so you can see more than 50 backups/100 share links
- The **Webhook Info** message command, which has a hidden response, now uses a direct link to Discohook for the "Use Webhook" button
- </webhook create:1> can now be used with media channels
- You can now click **Force Refresh** on your server's webhooks page to clear old (deleted) webhooks that are showing up in select menus on Discohook

## Fixed
- Fixed old link buttons sometimes refusing updates and deletions from within Discord
- Fixed the site sometimes ignoring message threads when editing components
- Fixed server channels and emojis not being loaded after creating a new webhook on the site
- Fixed confusing (but benign) errors that may have appeared after removing a webhook then attempting to edit a message
- Fixed behavior of default values when editing a message
- Fixed format options assuming every user has an animated avatar
- Fixed webhooks not being removed from site lists after their channel is deleted
- Fixed inability to remove deleted servers from site lists (log out and back in)

## Updates
- Arabic is once again 100% complete (as far as content that is currently translatable) thanks to @mew610
- A Czech translation is now available courtesy of @playmr365_
- </triggers add:1> now responds with a hidden message
- There is now a "Preview" label over the preview while editing a component
