description: "Role checks made easier"
---

## New
- It's now easier to check member roles with the new "Member has role" function - just add a check action and select it, then select your role. More info: [Recipes - Checks](discohook://guide/recipes/checks)
- Thread names are now formatted when using the "create thread" action (values are cut off to 100 characters after formatting)
  - Keep in mind thread names cannot use any markdown!
- Allowed mentions status is now indicated in the message header
- Components-based editors now have smoother animations

## Fixed
- Fixed nondescript error when creating a webhook with an avatar that was too large
- Container and embed accent color sidebars are now consistent with how Discord displays them
