## New
- If your server has media channels, you can now choose a post thumbnail from your attachments when creating a new thread
- You can now paste attachments directly from your clipboard (some file types may not be supported, which you'll have to upload normally)
- New counter for the "Wait" action (you can now hold the plus and minus signs to add/subtract rapidly, or input a value directly into the box)
- Messages can now be exported (downloaded) as plain JSON or as an importable backup in the JSON editor menu
- Added support for importing v1-2 backups
