Our old bot, Discobot, has now reached end-of-life. If you haven't already, you should add [Discohook Utils](<discohook://bot>) as a replacement. Run </reaction-role:1012780458544734278> to see if you should remove Discobot from your server.

## New
- Adding a webhook URL with a thread ID already in it (as was possible on our old site) will now prompt you to apply the thread ID to all messages in the editor.
- You can now create components-based messages without a special link just by clicking on "Add Message". You can shift-click the button to skip the new prompt, and set a default message type in your user settings.
- Servers with more than 50 webhooks can now see all of them on their server page by using the previous/next buttons
- You can now filter your backups by name in the popup backups menu
- GIF compatibility conversion is now available in the components-based message editor
- The standalone viewer page (sans editor) now supports a [`theme` and `avatar` parameter](<https://docs.discohook.app/doc-608486#previewing>)

## Fixed
- Fixed non-bot webhooks being unable to send components-based messages in flow actions
- Fixed an errant "missing file" warning when adding non-image files to the file component
- Fixed flows sometimes not appearing when loading a backup
- Fixed some thread messages erroring with Quick Edit

## Updates
- Media channel mentions are now properly handled on the site
- Inaccessible webhooks are now excluded from the "add webhook" menu to reduce clutter
