## New
- You can now favorite servers by clicking the ⭐ star icon on [your servers page](discohook://me/servers). This makes the server show at the top of all lists, like when adding a webhook
- All numeric values can now be used with an `_ordinal` suffix, like so:
  - `{server.members}` -> 100
  - `{server.members_ordinal}` -> 100th
  - `{server.boosts}` -> 2
  - `{server.boosts_ordinal}` -> 2nd

## Fixed
- Fixed embed titles and field names not previewing inline code properly (`` `text` ``) 
- Fixed short text inputs (like embed titles) defaulting to being 2 rows tall
- Fixed color picker inconsistencies, especially with hex codes that begin with zeros
- The `dhc-id` parameter is no longer added to link buttons automatically since this was breaking some sites unexpectedly. As a result, if you want to use the same URL and label for multiple link buttons, consider adding a fragment (`https://discohook.app#fragment`) to make them unique.
- Fixed some triggers (like welcomers & reaction roles) failing to run flows
- Fixed </welcomer set:1> taking too long to respond

## Updates
- Moved the "Customize" button to the select menu when creating a button (choose "Custom Flow"). This happened for various internal reasons, no functionality has changed
