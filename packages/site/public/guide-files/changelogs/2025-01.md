## New
- There is a new guide page regarding [button nesting](discohook://guide/recipes/nesting-buttons)
- You can now easily import your message designs into discord.py and discord.js by going to Options -> Code Generator under any message in the editor
- Link buttons can now be sent by user-owned webhooks
- You can now move attached image files into embeds by selecting them in the new "File" dropdown next to embed image inputs
- Partial Italian translation for bot command names & descriptions

## Fixed
- Reduced likelihood to get an error about saving components when submitting a message
- Fixed issue where an "invalid literal value" error would appear when using a default value with role select menus
- Improved compatibility with some older browser versions (always remember to update anyway!)
- Authentication failures should happen less frequently, if ever
- Fixed weird behavior and unresponsiveness when copying buttons, rows, & select menus on the site
- If a component is used in a server without Discohook Utils, you will now get an informative message instead of a failed interaction

## Updates
- Improved filename handling for using attachments in embeds (Discohook now knows that spaces will be replaced with underscores and will show that in the files section)
- There is now some useful editor info on [this guide page](<discohook://guide/getting-started/messages>)
