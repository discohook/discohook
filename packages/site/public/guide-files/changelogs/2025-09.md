## New
- You can now customize our botâ€™s name, avatar, banner, and bio (about me) in your server. Use the **/profile set** command or [your server page](discohook://me/servers). The bio can only be set on the server page.
  - This requires the **Manage Nicknames** permission.
  - Changes may take a while to show up properly on your device.
- Added new help tags about creating welcomers and customizing the bot profile

## Fixed
- Containers can now have a true black (#000) accent color
- Fixed preview overflow for section & text display components
- Fixed issue where the restore command could not fill webhook info owned by our legacy bot

## Updates
- The in-site help menu now left-aligns its embeds and sorts them by their source (simple tags or guide pages)
