## New
- New selection interfaces for backups, webhooks, and servers which are more friendly (less janky) & are searchable
- By writing a custom name for a message, you can now more easily identify them while editing - just press the pencil icon next to copy/delete
- There is now a "Sessions" tab on your server page which can be used to deauthorize malicious sessions if necessary (administrator permissions required)
- You can now set the "voice message" flag in the message flags menu, which will make it so that any audio attachments in the message are shown as voice recordings
  - This is not supported for components-based messages because of Discord limitations.
- Improved animated emoji detection when only an ID is provided to the custom emoji menu

## Fixed
- Fixed weird dismissal behavior with nested popup menus
- Fixed animated emojis not displaying in the preview

## Updates
- Refreshed styling for the theme selector & message sending menus
- Discohook Utils no longer asks for text input for true/false values, which some users found confusing
